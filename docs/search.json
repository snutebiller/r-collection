    "text": "A ggplot2 is initiated by the ggplot() command. When called on its own, it produces a graph without any data points. It is used to define options that will be forwarded to the functions responsible for adding data.\nA ggplot consists of layers that add graphical elements to the final plot. Layers are functions that begin with geom_ and define the type of plot. Examples are geom_point and geom_col, which create scatter and bar plots, respectively.\nThe general structure is as follows\nggplot() +\n  geom_\n\n\nThe data to be plotted can be provided in either the ggplot() function, which will forward it to the geom_ functions, or in the geom_ functions directly. In either way, the data.frame containing the data is specified as an argument directly, while the mapping function aes() contains information on which columns of the data.frame belong to which variable.\nggplot(data.frame, aes(x = independent.variable, y = dependent.variable)) +\n  geom_scatter()\nUsing the iris dataset, plotting the Sepal.Width against Sepal.Length works as follows\n\nggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is necessary to differentiate between different datasets if they are displayed within the same graph.
