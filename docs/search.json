    "text": "A ggplot2 is initiated by the ggplot() command. When called on its own, it produces a graph without any data points. It is used to define options that will be forwarded to the functions responsible for adding data.\nA ggplot consists of layers that add graphical elements to the final plot. Layers are functions that begin with geom_ and define the type of plot. Examples are geom_point and geom_col, which create scatter and bar plots, respectively.\nThe general structure is as follows\nggplot() +\n  geom_\n\n\nThe data to be plotted can be provided in either the ggplot() function, which will forward it to the geom_ functions, or in the geom_ functions directly. In either way, the data.frame containing the data is specified as an argument directly, while the mapping function aes() contains information on which columns of the data.frame belong to which variable.\nggplot(data.frame, aes(x = independent.variable, y = dependent.variable)) +\n  geom_scatter()\nUsing the iris dataset, plotting the Sepal.Width against Sepal.Length works as follows\n\nggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is necessary to differentiate between different datasets if they are displayed within the same graph. This can be easily done by assigning factors to data points originating from different datasets. Using the mappings colour = factor.variable or fill = factor.variable in the aes() function leads to colouring of the data points according to their factor. A legend is added automatically.\n\nggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nThis is very powerful in settings during which data processing is performed. In the example, the confidence intervals and the fitted line of the different datasets are drawn by the same commands (geom_ribbon() and geom_line(), respectively), while colouring the fit according to the colour mapping and the confidence interval according to the fill mapping.\n\n# fit the data, perform prediction, join the data.frame with the corresponding\n# independent variables\nprediction_values_for_plot &lt;- lm(Sepal.Width ~ Sepal.Length * Species, iris) |&gt;\n                  predict(interval = 'confidence') |&gt;\n                    cbind(iris)\n\nggplot(prediction_values_for_plot, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, ymin = lwr, ymax = upr,\n                                       colour = Species, fill = Species)) +\n  geom_ribbon(aes(y = fit), alpha = 0.3, linewidth = 0) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = fit)) +\n  geom_point()"
